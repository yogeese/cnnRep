Every change in the code is committed to track including the notes.

- Notes: Each repo should contain markdown notes in the notes directory to document the code. The journal.md file is for light logging of what is being done and refers to other markdown files if needed. A report.md should also be there housing all the graphs and information taken from the experiment.
- setup.sh: the first script to run. Sets up the environment - typically a docker container for the project.
- run.sh: script with running the project inside the setup docker container
